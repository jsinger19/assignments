### "Climate change by the numbers." by S. Fred Singer

#### Analysis

Dr. S. Fred Singer’s article “Climate change by the numbers.” is essentially a rebuttal letter to an essay written by Mr. Bob Ward published several days earlier in *Shanghai Daily*. Dr. Singer’s main argument is that Mr. Ward promotes an alarmist view of climate change by presenting the conclusions of the IPCC which ignores dissenting credible scientific publications. This argument is of particular interest since the IPCC is an organization dedicated to providing governments with objective scientific information which they can use to develop climate policies (IPCC, n.d.). Through their review process, the IPCC strives “to ensure an objective and complete assessment and to reflect a diverse range of views and expertise” (IPCC, n.d.). 

It is necessary to first assess both authors’ credentials and affiliations. Mr. Ward is the Policy and Communications Director of the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science (Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, 2014). He holds a first degree in geology and an unfinished PhD on palaeopiezometry (Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, 2014). Mr. Ward has experience leading the media relations team at the Royal Society and has worked as a freelance science journalist (Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment, 2014). Dr. Singer was an atmospheric and space physicist who founded the Science and Environmental Policy Project (SEPP) and the Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change (NIPCC) (Thorne, 2011). He obtained both a Master’s degree and PhD from Princeton University (Thorne, 2011). Dr. Singer has held many esteemed positions: he was the founding dean of the University of Miami School of Environmental and Planetary Sciences, a professor emeritus of environmental science at the University of Virginia, and the deputy assistant administrator for the Environmental Protection Agency, among others (Thorne, 2011). His article is published as an editorial on the SEPP website weekly recap of events. 

Except for citing Mr. Ward’s article, Dr. Singer does not include references for the information he provides. He mentions the Kyoto Protocol and despite him calling it a complete failure, it can actually serve as a model for improvement (Napoli, 2012). Dr. Singer briefly introduces the IPCC and describes its reliance upon the agreement of climate models and observations, then claims that models cannot reproduce most of the observations so the IPCC’s conclusions are faulty. However, there is an entire chapter in the IPCC AR4 that assesses and evaluates the models employed and how the IPCC continually improves their accuracy (Randall et al., 2007). Dr. Singer mentions that in response to the perceived disagreement of models and observations, a competing body (the NIPCC) has been established to provide alternative evidence. 

Interestingly, Mr. Ward mentions in his article that the rate of increase of global surface temperature was lower over the past fifteen years than before, but almost all climate scientists believe this is just temporary (Ward, 2013). While Dr. Singer paraphrases this point inaccurately, he does mention that Mr. Ward does not acknowledge that this finding disagrees with all climate model predictions which are supposed to be accurate. This confoundment exemplifies the controversies surrounding climate change science. Dr. Singer then claims that the IPCC Summary for Policymakers is compiled by a select group of politically-oriented scientists who “cherry-pick” evidence and ignore contrary evidence. In fact, the IPCC has a policy to prevent conflicts of interest and authors are selected based on their expertise (IPCC, 2016; IPCC Secretariat, 2013). Dr. Singer states that the Summary is used by politicians to create policies to manage energy use. He then mentions the economic efforts several countries were considering implementing but provides no references. Dr. Singer concludes by claiming CO2 should not be considered a pollutant—a most contentious statement upon which he does not elaborate. The article is overall questionable and should not be considered as fact.
